# zedboard_base_20202
Vitis Embedded Acceleration Platform for Zedboard (Vitis 2020.2)

Creation steps have been documented in this repository.

I have problems with software and hardware emulation(which can be tackled by downloading other board platforms, in my case it was zcu102 board files from xilinx website), however hardware target runs flawlessly.

**Copy zedboard_base_20202 under Vitis/202x.x/platforms/ and open Vitis and create a new Application Project. If you were in my situation, I just hope this could help you.**
