# zedboard_base_20202
Vitis Embedded Acceleration Platform for Zedboard (Vitis 2020.2)

I'm trying to learn Vitis Acceleration Programming and want to use zedboard. However, I cannot find official Vitis Platform for zedboard, so I have created one.

Creation steps have been documented in this repository [here](platform-creation-steps.md).

I have problems with software and hardware emulation(which can be tackled by downloading other board platforms, in my case it was zcu102 board files from [xilinx website](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms/archive-vitis-embedded.html)), however hardware target runs flawlessly.

**Copy zedboard_base_20202 under Vitis/2020.2/platforms/ and open Vitis and create a new Application Project. If you were in my situation, I just hope this could help you.**
