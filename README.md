# zedboard_base_20202
Vitis Embedded Acceleration Platform for Zedboard (Vitis 2020.2)

Creation steps have been documented in this repository.

I have problems with software and hardware emulation(which can be tackled by downloading other board platforms, in my case it was zcu102 board files from [xilinx website](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms/archive-vitis-embedded.html)), however hardware target runs flawlessly.

**Copy zedboard_base_20202 under Vitis/202x.x/platforms/ and open Vitis and create a new Application Project. If you were in my situation, I just hope this could help you.**
